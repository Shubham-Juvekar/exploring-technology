WebSockets Pros and Cons  

Pros
1. Full-duplex no need for constant polling  
2. compatible with HTTP, so proxies know to deal with it
3. Firewalls won’t block it doesn’t use a special port
Cons
1. Proxying is tricky, lots of proxies and transparent proxies don’t support it yet
2. Layer 7 load balancing is tricky, timeouts on the load balancer. 
3. More complicated to implement (simple telnet use HTTP)
4. Not ideal for all use cases - (microservices)
